The library allows for playing oscilloscope music using Helios DAC, enabling users to visualize audio signals as intricate patterns and shapes directly on an oscilloscope's screen through precise digital-to-analog conversion. 

It has been tested on Python 3.12.1 (32-bit version) as the Helios library only supports this version. The software is designed for Windows, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to linux users.
